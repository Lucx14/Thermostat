Thermostat Project Javascript

Week 5 at Makers academy we were introduced to Javascript for the first time. We were asked over the course of 1 week to pair program on this project to build the logic to model a simple thermostat and learn to hook it up to a dynamic visual interface using jQuery, all within the browser. We used a Test driven approach with the Jasmine testing framework.
